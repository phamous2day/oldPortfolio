It took me a week to work on the HTML pages. I remember making my first website and uploading it to my school's server, but they took it down. I was pretty damn sad.

So, I uploaded a lot of my articles, videos, etc. on other services. Eventually, when I learned how GitHub can hosts web pages, I jumped at the opportunity to try see if I got the chops to make a sweet webpages with new technologies I picked up along the way (jQuery, javascript, etc.).

The result you see in the index.html is the result of all my hard work. I hope you enjoy it!
